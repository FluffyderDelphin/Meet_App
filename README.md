Feature 1;
As a user
I should be able to “filter events by city”
So that I can see the list of events that take place in that city


SCENARIO 1: 
Given user hasn’t searched for any city
When the user opens the app
Then the user should see a list of all upcoming events

SCENARIO 2: 
Given the main page is open
When user starts typing in the city textbox
Then the user should see a list of cities (suggestions) that match what they’ve typed

SCENARIO 3: 
Given the user was typing “Berlin” in the city textbox
And the list of suggested cities is showing
When the user selects a city (e.g., “Berlin, Germany”) from the list
Then their city should be changed to that city (i.e., “Berlin, Germany”)
And the user should receive a list of upcoming events in that city



Feature 2:
As a user I should be able to expand and collapse Events, to see and hide Details. 

SCENARIO 1:
Given the user has not clicked on any Event
Then they are collapsed by default.

SCENARIO 2:
Given the Event is collapsed
When the User clicks on it (or a Button 'expand').
Then the Event expands showing Details.

SCENARIO 3:
Given the Event is expanded.
When the user clicks on it (or a Button 'hide'). 
Then the Even gets collapsed again. 

Feature 3:

As a user I should be able to set specify  the numbers of Events, so that I can limit the Amount I see on the List. 

SCENARIO 1:
Given the user hasnt specified a Number and looks for Events.
When the User looks for the Events.
The number of Events displayed is 32 by default. 

SCENARIO 2:
Given the User looks for Events.
When the user specifies a number of Events.
Then the Number of displayed Events changes.


Feature 4:

As a user  I should be able to view my information offline, so that I can check Events even without Internet Access. 

SCENARIO 1:
Given the User has no internet Connection.
When there is cached Data.
Then the user schould still be able to view the Events stored in the cache.

SCENARIO 2:
Given the User has no internet Connection.
When the users tries to change the Search Settings.
Then he gets an Error Message.

Feature 5:

As a user I should be able to view Charts that visualizes Event Data, so I can soo how the Events are distributed over different Cities

SCENARIO 1:
Given there are a number of Events in different Cities
When the Users opens the Chart. 
Then he can see how many Events are distributed over different Cities on the Chart.
